## Monarch Butterfly

Experimental FFT library with an emphasis on runtime performance.
This currently only works on powers of two. The FFTs are autogenerated
with a procedural macro which hand unrolls all the loops with inlined
functions to allow the compiler to maximize the SIMD throughput available
on the given CPU.

This library implements FFTs for both `f32` and `f64` for the following sizes:
```
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048
```

If a larger FFT size is needed, just clone the repo and add the needed
sizes to the top of `crates\monarch-derive\src\lib.rs` and larger FFTs
will be generated. However, this comes at the cost of a longer compile time.

```
use monarch_butterfly::*;
use num_complex::Complex;

let input: Vec<_> = (0..8).map(|i| Complex::new(i as f32, 0.0)).collect();
let output_slice = fft8(&input);
let output_vec = fft8(input);
```
